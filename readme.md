Right now just for myself, but could be used by other people without too much work.

Work that could be done to make this more generally usable for anyone:

- in `index.js`, load `.bookindex2-config.mjs` from the user directory instead of a hardcoded directory
- allow using only one or the other of Google Books or isbndb, instead of assuming both
- configure different location barcode prefixes besides `JD`
